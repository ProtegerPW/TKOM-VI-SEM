# TKOM-VI-SEM

Program to sort mails based on key-words.

The main aim was to design some kind of mail-compiler with own lexer, parser, semantic analyzer and error module. Because natural language is quite sophisticated I had to develop my own simple grammar.

## Launch program
```
python main.py <path to analyzed mail>
```
